# Pixel Art for Images and Videos
Use `pixelart_image.py` to generate pixel art for images and `pixelart_video.py` for videos.

Tunable parameters are size of each "square pixel" and number of colors in the generated pixel art.

Here are side-by-side comparisons of an image and its pixel art. Both images have 10 colors and 4x4 pixel size per "square pixel". 8x8 pixel variations of each image can be found in the `sample images` folder.

A video clip example can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHsXOqVr6LA). It is the `sample video pixel art.mp4` file included in this repo.
